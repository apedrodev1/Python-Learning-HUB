# Calculating Student Averages


## Description
This project calculates student averages using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The system allows for both arithmetic and weighted averages based on user input and provides a simple report card with each student's status (pass or fail) based on a customizable passing average.

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository
2. Clone this repository to your local environment:
   
Copy code:
<code>git clone <https://github.com/apedrodev1/Python-Learning-HUB/tree/main/M%C3%A9dia%20aluno%20OOP></code>

3. Open the Project in Your IDE
 (make sure you have the python extention installed)  
4. Open the `index.py` file in your preferred IDE.
5. Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and start the program:
`bash`
<code>python index.py</code>

6. Interact with the Program

## Run the Program:

- Enter each student’s name.
- Set the required passing average.
- Choose the type of average calculation: arithmetic or weighted.
- Enter the desired grades (and weights, if weighted average is chosen).
- View the generated report card, showing grades, required average, student’s average, and pass/fail status.
- Repeat or Exit
- The program will prompt you to add another student or exit.

## Features:

- Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes a Student class with methods for calculating arithmetic and weighted averages.
- User Choice for Average Type: Choose between an arithmetic or weighted average based on your needs.
- Dynamic Grade and Weight Entry: Allows you to enter multiple grades, with optional weights for each grade if a weighted average is selected.
- Clear Screen Functionality: For a cleaner and more organized user experience.
- Report Card Display: Shows each student’s name, grades, required average, calculated average, and pass/fail status.
- Data Export in JSON and XML: Provides the option to export student data in JSON and XML formats, making it easy to save, share, and integrate with other systems.
