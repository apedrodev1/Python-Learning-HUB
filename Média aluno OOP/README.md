# Calculating Student Averages


## Description
This project calculates student averages using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The system allows for both arithmetic and weighted averages based on user input and provides a simple report card with each student's status (pass or fail) based on a customizable passing average.

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository
2. Clone this repository to your local environment:
   
Copy code:
<code>git clone <https://github.com/apedrodev1/Python-Learning-HUB/tree/main/M%C3%A9dia%20aluno%20OOP></code>


3. Open the Project in Your IDE
4. Open the `index.py` file in your preferred IDE.

## Run the Program
Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and start the program:
`bash`
<code>python index.py</code>
Interact with the Program


## Enter each student’s name.
Set the required passing average.
Choose the type of average calculation: arithmetic or weighted.
Enter the desired grades (and weights, if weighted average is chosen).
View the generated report card, showing grades, required average, student’s average, and pass/fail status.
Repeat or Exit
The program will prompt you to add another student or exit.

## Features:
Object-Oriented Design: Uses a Student class with methods for calculating arithmetic and weighted averages.
User Choice for Average Type: Select either an arithmetic or weighted average based on your needs.
Dynamic Grade and Weight Entry: Allows you to enter multiple grades, with optional weights for each grade if a weighted average is selected.
Clear Screen Functionality: For a cleaner user experience.
Report Card Display: Shows each student’s name, grades, required average, calculated average, and pass/fail status.
